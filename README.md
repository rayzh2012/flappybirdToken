# flappybirdToken

Flappy bird token is created in response to my unsuccessful attempts to publish blockchain technology to IEEE GEM with a bird based game.

Basic premise:
Touch as the stimuli for mining calculation, and use difficulties to limit the token supplies in order to generate scarcity.

Flow:
touch->difficulty changes->hit detection->if hit->coin detection-ã€‹coin issued
